                      * `default_transaction_isolation` - defines the default isolation level to be set for all new SQL transactions. One of:  - 0: `unspecified`
                      - 1: `read uncommitted`
                      - 2: `read committed`
                      - 3: `repeatable read`
                      - 4: `serializable`

                      * `lock_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) for any statement to wait for acquiring a lock on an table, index, row or other database object (default 0)

                      * `log_min_duration_statement` - This setting controls logging of the duration of statements. (default -1 disables logging of the duration of statements.)

                      * `synchronous_commit` - This setting defines whether DBMS will commit transaction in a synchronous way. One of:
                      - 0: `unspecified`
                      - 1: `on`
                      - 2: `off`

                      - 4: `remote write`
                      - 5: `remote apply`

                      * `temp_file_limit` - The maximum storage space size (in kilobytes) that a single process can use to create temporary files.

                      * `log_statement` - This setting specifies which SQL statements should be logged (on the user level). One of:
                      - 0: `unspecified`
                      - 1: `none`
                      - 2: `ddl`

                      - 4: `all`

                      * `pool_mode` - Mode that the connection pooler is working in with specified user. One of:
                      - 1: `session`
                      - 2: `transaction`
                      - 3: `statement`

                      * `prepared_statements_pooling` - This setting allows user to use prepared statements with transaction pooling. Boolean.

                      * `catchup_timeout` - The connection pooler setting. It determines the maximum allowed replication lag (in seconds). Pooler will reject connections to the replica with a lag above this threshold. Default value is 0, which disables this feature. Integer.

                      * `wal_sender_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for WAL replication (can be set only for PostgreSQL 12+). Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer than this amount of time. Integer.

                      * `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` - Sets the maximum allowed idle time (in milliseconds) between queries, when in a transaction. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer.

                      * `statement_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for statement. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer
