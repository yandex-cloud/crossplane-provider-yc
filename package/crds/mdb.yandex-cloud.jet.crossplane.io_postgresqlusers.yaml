                      * `catchup_timeout` - The connection pooler setting. It determines the maximum allowed replication lag (in seconds). Pooler will reject connections to the replica with a lag above this threshold. Default value is 0, which disables this feature. Integer.

                      * `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` - Sets the maximum allowed idle time (in milliseconds) between queries, when in a transaction. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer.

                      * `statement_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for statement. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer
