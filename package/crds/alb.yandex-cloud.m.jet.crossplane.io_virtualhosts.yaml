                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                                        Specifies the idle timeout (time without any data transfer for the active request) for the route. It is useful for streaming scenarios (i.e. long-polling, server-sent events) - one should set idle_timeout to something meaningful and timeout to the maximum time the stream is allowed to be alive. If not specified, there is no per-route idle timeout.
