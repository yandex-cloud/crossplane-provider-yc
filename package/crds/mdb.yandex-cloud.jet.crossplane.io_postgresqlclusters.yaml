                            * `default_transaction_isolation` - defines the default isolation level to be set for all new SQL transactions. One of:  - 0: `unspecified`
                            - 1: `read uncommitted`

                            * `lock_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) for any statement to wait for acquiring a lock on an table, index, row or other database object (default 0)

                            * `log_min_duration_statement` - This setting controls logging of the duration of statements. (default -1 disables logging of the duration of statements.)

                            * `synchronous_commit` - This setting defines whether DBMS will commit transaction in a synchronous way. One of:
                            - 0: `unspecified`
                            - 1: `on`

                            * `temp_file_limit` - The maximum storage space size (in kilobytes) that a single process can use to create temporary files.

                            * `log_statement` - This setting specifies which SQL statements should be logged (on the user level). One of:
                            - 0: `unspecified`
                            - 1: `none`

                            * `pool_mode` - Mode that the connection pooler is working in with specified user. One of:

                            * `catchup_timeout` - The connection pooler setting. It determines the maximum allowed replication lag (in seconds). Pooler will reject connections to the replica with a lag above this threshold. Default value is 0, which disables this feature. Integer.

                            * `wal_sender_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for WAL replication (can be set only for PostgreSQL 12+). Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer than this amount of time. Integer.

                            * `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` - Sets the maximum allowed idle time (in milliseconds) between queries, when in a transaction. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer.

                            * `statement_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for statement. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer

                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception

                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to

                            * `default_transaction_isolation` - defines the default isolation level to be set for all new SQL transactions. One of:  - 0: `unspecified`
                            - 1: `read uncommitted`
                            - 2: `read committed`

                            - 4: `serializable`

                            * `lock_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) for any statement to wait for acquiring a lock on an table, index, row or other database object (default 0)

                            * `log_min_duration_statement` - This setting controls logging of the duration of statements. (default -1 disables logging of the duration of statements.)

                            * `synchronous_commit` - This setting defines whether DBMS will commit transaction in a synchronous way. One of:
                            - 0: `unspecified`
                            - 1: `on`

                            * `temp_file_limit` - The maximum storage space size (in kilobytes) that a single process can use to create temporary files.

                            * `log_statement` - This setting specifies which SQL statements should be logged (on the user level). One of:
                            - 0: `unspecified`
                            - 1: `none`

                            - 4: `all`

                            * `pool_mode` - Mode that the connection pooler is working in with specified user. One of:
                            - 1: `session`
                            - 2: `transaction`

                            * `prepared_statements_pooling` - This setting allows user to use prepared statements with transaction pooling. Boolean.

                            * `catchup_timeout` - The connection pooler setting. It determines the maximum allowed replication lag (in seconds). Pooler will reject connections to the replica with a lag above this threshold. Default value is 0, which disables this feature. Integer.

                            * `wal_sender_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for WAL replication (can be set only for PostgreSQL 12+). Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer than this amount of time. Integer.

                            * `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` - Sets the maximum allowed idle time (in milliseconds) between queries, when in a transaction. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer.

                            * `statement_timeout` - The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for statement. Value of 0 (default) disables the timeout. Integer
