                                  * `hash` - hash join algorithm is used. The most generic implementation that supports all combinations of kind and strictness and multiple join keys that are combined with OR in the JOIN ON section.
                                  * `parallel_hash` - a variation of hash join that splits the data into buckets and builds several hash tables instead of one concurrently to speed up this process.
                                  * `partial_merge` - a variation of the sort-merge algorithm, where only the right table is fully sorted.
                                  * `direct` - this algorithm can be applied when the storage for the right table supports key-value requests.
                                  * `auto` - when set to auto, hash join is tried first, and the algorithm is switched on the fly to another algorithm if the memory limit is violated.
                                  * `full_sorting_merge` - sort-merge algorithm with full sorting joined tables before joining.
                                  * `prefer_partial_merge` - clickHouse always tries to use partial_merge join if possible, otherwise, it uses hash. Deprecated, same as partial_merge,hash.

                                  * `parallel_hash` - a variation of hash join that splits the data into buckets and builds several hash tables instead of one concurrently to speed up this process.
                                  * `partial_merge` - a variation of the sort-merge algorithm, where only the right table is fully sorted.
                                  * `direct` - this algorithm can be applied when the storage for the right table supports key-value requests.
                                  * `auto` - when set to auto, hash join is tried first, and the algorithm is switched on the fly to another algorithm if the memory limit is violated.
                                  * `full_sorting_merge` - sort-merge algorithm with full sorting joined tables before joining.
                                  * `prefer_partial_merge` - clickHouse always tries to use partial_merge join if possible, otherwise, it uses hash. Deprecated, same as partial_merge,hash.

                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default

                                  * `hash` - hash join algorithm is used. The most generic implementation that supports all combinations of kind and strictness and multiple join keys that are combined with OR in the JOIN ON section.
                                  * `parallel_hash` - a variation of hash join that splits the data into buckets and builds several hash tables instead of one concurrently to speed up this process.
                                  * `partial_merge` - a variation of the sort-merge algorithm, where only the right table is fully sorted.
                                  * `direct` - this algorithm can be applied when the storage for the right table supports key-value requests.
                                  * `auto` - when set to auto, hash join is tried first, and the algorithm is switched on the fly to another algorithm if the memory limit is violated.
                                  * `full_sorting_merge` - sort-merge algorithm with full sorting joined tables before joining.
                                  * `prefer_partial_merge` - clickHouse always tries to use partial_merge join if possible, otherwise, it uses hash. Deprecated, same as partial_merge,hash.
